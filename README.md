# DuoAdmin
Drop in package for accessing the Duo Admin API @ https://duo.com/docs/adminapi

Take note that this formats the date as `Wed, 16 Oct 2019 18:42:30 GMT` not `Wed, 16 Oct 2019 18:42:30 -0000`

This is a deviation from the official docs, but works, whereas the latter does not.

Use at your own risk.
